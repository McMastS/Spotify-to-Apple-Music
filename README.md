# Spotify-to-Apple-Music

I find myself enjoying Spotify playlists much more than I enjoy the Apple Music playlists, so I decided to create this web app to port any
Spotify playlist to an Apple Music account. This project is still ongoing, and I will update this doc whenever I make progress.

If you want to run this on your own server, you'd need a config file that contains the necessary keys and secrets.

Todo:
1. The app became much bigger than expected, so reorganize the code using Flask best practices for structure
2. Add a login/user account functionality
3. Deploy (probably using Heroku)
